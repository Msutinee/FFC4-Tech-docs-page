    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.</p>

    <h2>Adding CSS to our document</h2>
    <article>
    <p>The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that we have some CSS rules we want it to use. There are three different ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come across, however, for now, we will look at the most usual and useful way of doing so — linking CSS from the head of your document.</p>
    <p>Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it as <span>styles.css.</span> The <span>.css</span> extension shows that this is a CSS file.</p>
    <p>To link <span>styles.css</span> to <span>index.html</span> add the following line somewhere inside the <span>&lt;head&gt;</span>of the HTML document:</p><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;</code>
    <p>This &lt;link&gt; element tells the browser that we have a stylesheet, using the rel attribute, and the location of that stylesheet as the value of the href attribute. You can test that the CSS works by adding a rule to styles.css. Using your code editor add the following to your CSS file:</p>
    <code>h1 {
  color: red;
}</code>
    <p>Save your HTML and CSS files and reload the page in a web browser. The level one heading at the top of the document should now be red. If that happens, congratulations — you have successfully applied some CSS to an HTML document. If that doesn't happen, carefully check that you've typed everything correctly.</p>
    <p>You can continue to work in <span>styles.css</span> locally, or you can use our interactive editor below to continue with this tutorial. The interactive editor acts as if the CSS in the first panel is linked to the HTML document, just as we have with our document above.</p>

    <h2>Styling HTML elements</h2>
    <article>
    <p>By making our heading red we have already demonstrated that we can target and style an HTML element. We do this by targeting an <i>element selector —</i> this is a selector that directly matches an HTML element name. To target all paragraphs in the document you would use the selector <span>p</span>. To turn all paragraphs green you would use:</p>
    <code>p {
  color: green;
}
    </code>
    <p>You can target multiple selectors at once, by separating the selectors with a comma. If I want all paragraphs and all list items to be green my rule looks like this:</p>
    <code>
      p, li {
    color: green;
}
    </code>
    <p>Try this out in the interactive editor below (edit the code boxes), or in your local CSS document.</p>
      <div class="box preview-box">
        <h1>I am a level one heading</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph of text. In the text is a span element and also a <a href="#">link</a>.</p>
        <p>This is the second paragraph. It contains an <i>emphasized element</i>.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Item one</li>
          <li>Item two</li>
          <li>Item three</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <code>h1 {

}

p {
    
}
      </code>
      <code> &lt;h1&gt;I am a level one heading&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph of text. In the text is a &lt;span&gt;span element&lt;/span&gt; 
and also a lt href="http://example.com"&gt;link&lt;/lt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p>This is the second paragraph. It contains an &lt;em>emphasized&lt;/em&gt; element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Item one&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Item two&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Item &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <h2>Changing the default behavior of elements</h2>
    <article>
      <p>When we look at a well-marked up HTML document, even something as simple as our example, we can see how the browser is making the HTML readable by adding some default styling. Headings are large and bold and our list has bullets. This happens because browsers have internal stylesheets containing default styles, which they apply to all pages by default; without them all of the text would run together in a clump and we would have to style everything from scratch. All modern browsers display HTML content by default in pretty much the same way.</p>
      <p>However, you will often want something other than the choice the browser has made. This can be done by simply choosing the HTML element that you want to change, and using a CSS rule to change the way it looks.  A good example is our <span>&lt;ul&gt;</span>, an unordered list. It has list bullets, and if I decide I don't want those bullets I can remove them like so:</p>
      <code>
        li {
  list-style-type: none;
}
      </code>
      <p>Try adding this to your CSS now.</p>
      <p>The <span>list-style-type</span> property is a good property to look at on MDN to see which values are supported. Take a look at the page for <span>list-style-type</span> and you will find an interactive example at the top of the page to try some different values in, then all allowable values are detailed further down the page.</p>
      <p>Looking at that page you will discover that in addition to removing the list bullets you can change them — try changing them to square bullets by using a value of <span>square.</span></p>

  <section id="adding-class" class="main-section">
    <h2>Adding a class</h2>
    <article>
      <p>So far we have styled elements based on their HTML element names. This works as long as you want all of the elements of that type in your document to look the same. Most of the time that isn't the case and so you will need to find a way to select a subset of the elements without changing the others. The most common way to do this is to add a class to your HTML element and target that class.</p>
      <p>In your HTML document, add a class attribute to the second list item. Your list will now look like this:</p>
      <code>
        &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Item one&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li class="special"&gt;Item two&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Item &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
      </code>
      <p>In your CSS you can target the class of special by creating a selector that starts with a full stop character. Add the following to your CSS file:</p>
      <code>.special {
  color: orange;
  font-weight: bold;
}</code>
      <p>Save and refresh to see what the result is.</p>
      <p>You can apply the class of <span>special</span> to any element on your page that you want to have the same look as this list item. For example, you might want the <span>&lt;span&gt;</span> in the paragraph to also be orange and bold. Try adding a <span>class</span> of <span>special</span> to it, then reload your page and see what happens.</p>
      <p>Sometimes you will see rules with a selector that lists the HTML element selector along with the class:</p>
      <code>li.special {
  color: orange;
  font-weight: bold;
}
      </code>
      <p>This syntax means "target any <span>li</span> element that has a class of special". If you were to do this then you would no longer be able to apply the class to a <span>&lt;span&gt;</span> or another element by simply adding the class to it; you would have to add that element to the list of selectors:</p>
      <code>li.special,
span.special {
  color: orange;
  font-weight: bold;
}
      </code>
      <p>As you can imagine, some classes might be applied to many elements and you don't want to have to keep editing your CSS every time something new needs to take on that style. Therefore it is sometimes best to bypass the element and simply refer to the class, unless you know that you want to create some special rules for one element alone, and perhaps want to make sure they are not applied to other things.</p>
